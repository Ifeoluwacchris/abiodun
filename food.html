      <h2>carbohydrates</h2>
      <p></p>
      <ul>
    Carbohydrates, or carbs, are sugar molecules. Along with proteins and
    fats, carbohydrates are one of three main nutrients found in foods and
 drinks. Your body breaks down carbohydrates into glucose. Glucose, or
        blood sugar, is the main source of energy for your body's cells,
        tissues, and organs.

        <li>potatoes</li>
        <li>lentils</li>
        <li>oats</li>
        <li>bread</li>
      </ul>
      <p>are essential food nutrients. Your body turns carbs into glucose (blood sugar) to give you the energy you need to function. Complex carbs in fruits, vegetables and whole-grain foods are less likely to spike blood sugar than simple carbs (sugars).

      <h2>proteins</h2>
      <p>
        any of a class of nitrogenous organic compounds that have large molecules composed of one or more long chains of amino acids and are an essential part of all living organisms, especially as structural components of body tissues such as muscle, hair, etc., and as enzymes and antibodies.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>meat</li>
        <li>egg</li>
        <li>lamb</li>
        <li>crab</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Proteins are needed for the body to function properly. They are the basis of body structures, such as skin and hair, and of other substances such as enzymes, cytokines, and antibodies.

      <h2>fats</h2>
      <p>a natural oily substance occurring in animal bodies, especially when deposited as a layer under the skin or around certain organs.

        <li>chia seeds</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        ny of a group of natural esters of glycerol and various fatty acids, which are solid at room temperature and are the main constituents of animal and vegetable fat.

      <h2>vitamins</h2>
      <p>
        A nutrient that the body needs in small amounts to function and stay healthy. Sources of vitamins are plant and animal food products and dietary supplements. Some vitamins are made in the human body from food products.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>fish</li>
        <li>broccoli</li>
        <li>pork</li>
        <li>nuts</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        any of a group of organic compounds which are essential for normal growth and nutrition and are required in small quantities in the diet because they cannot be synthesized by the body.
      </p>

      <h2>minerals</h2>
      <p>
        Mineral is a naturally occurring inorganic solid with a definite chemical composition and a crystalline structure.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>calcium</li>
        <li>chloride</li>
        <li>magnesium</li>
        <li>sodium</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        
      </p>A mineral is a natural substance with distinctive chemical and physical properties, composition, and atomic structure. The definition of an economic mineral is broader, and includes minerals, metals, rocks and hydrocarbons (solid and liquid) that are extracted from the earth by mining, quarrying and pumping.
