    <h1>class of food</h1>
    <p>
      Nutrition plays a pivotal role in our well-being. Among the essential classes of food, carbohydrates serve as our primary energy source, found in staples like rice, bread, and pasta.
Proteins, derived from meat, legumes, and dairy, are vital for muscle repair and growth. Fats, present in nuts and oils, contribute to overall health. Fiber, abundant in fruits and vegetables, aids digestion. Minerals and vitamins, obtained from various foods, support bodily functions. Lastly, water, found in fruits, juices, and beverages, is indispensable for hydration and life itself.

      <p>
        a natural oily substance occurring in animal bodies, especially when deposited as a layer under the skin or around certain organs.ny of a group of natural esters of glycerol and various fatty acids, which are solid at room temperature and are the main constituents of animal and vegetable fat.Fats and oils are essential components of a balanced diet, providing energy and supporting various bodily functions.
        Fats are composed of fatty acids, with saturated fats being solid at room temperature and found mainly in animal products like butter and red meat. These fats, while necessary in moderation, can contribute to elevated cholesterol levels when consumed excessively. Unsaturated fats, on the other hand, are liquid at room temperature and primarily come from plant sources like olive oil, nuts, and avocados. These fats are beneficial for heart health, helping to lower LDL (bad) cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases.
